# Code of Conduct

## Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in GitHub Community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

The following are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

- Engage with consideration and respect.
  - **Be welcoming and open-minded** - New users join our community each day. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.
  - **Be respectful** - Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to deescalate a tense situation.
  - **Be empathetic** - GitHub is a global community with people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help make GitHub a community where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.

- Contribute in a positive and constructive way.
  - **Improve the discussion.** Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

    The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.
  - **Be clear and stay on topic.** GitHub Community is for collaboration, sharing ideas, and helping each other get stuff done. Off-topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions.

    This applies to sharing links, as well. Any links shared in GitHub Community discussions should be shared with the intent of providing relevant and appropriate information. Links should not be posted to simply drive traffic or attention to a site. Links should always be accompanied by a full explanation of the content and purpose of the link. Posting links, especially unsolicited ones, without relevant and valuable context can come across as advertising or serving even more malicious purposes.

  - **Share mindfully.** When asking others to give you feedback or collaborate on a project, only share valuable and relevant resources to provide context. Don't post links that don't add value to the discussion, and don't post unsolicited links to your own projects or sites on other user's threads.

    Additionally, don't share sensitive information. This includes your own email address. We don't allow the sharing of such information in GitHub Community, as it can create security and privacy risks for the poster, as well as other users. If you'd like to invite other GitHub users to collaborate on a project or work with you, share a link to the repository in which the project you are working on exists. By sharing the link to your project repo - with some information on what your project is and what kind of help or feedback you're looking for - you can invite others to collaborate with you via issues or pull requests without having to share your private information. You can also add others as outside collaborators on your project repo to give them special permissions to help you develop your project.
  - **Keep it tidy.** Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up. So:
    - Don’t start a discussion in the wrong category.
    - Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple discussions.
    - Don’t post no-content replies.
    - Don't "bump" posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share.
    - Don’t divert a discussion by changing it midstream.

    Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the upvote button. Rather than taking an existing discussion in a radically different direction, open a new discussion.

- Be trustworthy.
  - **Always be honest.** Don’t knowingly share incorrect information or intentionally mislead other GitHub Community participants. If you don’t know the answer to someone’s question but still want to help, you can try helping them research or find resources instead. GitHub staff will also be active in GitHub Community, so if you’re unsure of an answer, it’s likely a moderator will be able to help.
