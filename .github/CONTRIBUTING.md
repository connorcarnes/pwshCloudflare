# Development Environment

You can develop pwshCloudflare locally, in a container directly on your local machine assuming you have same PowerShell version used to build and test the project (currently 7.4 or 5.1). Other versions may work but they might also lead to bugs and a frustrating development experience. You can also develop locally in a Docker container or remotely using [GitHub CodeSpaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces). Both of these options use Microsoft's [Development Container specification](https://containers.dev/). This guide focuses on local development using Docker and has only been tested on VS Code.

## Setup

Clone the project repository, open it in VS Code and install the [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). You can install it individually or via [Microsoft's Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack). VS Code might prompt you to install Docker if you don't have it installed. You can install it by accepting the VS Code prompt or [with the instructions on this page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). If you already have Docker installed make sure it's updated to a recent version. At this point VS Code may prompt you to reopen the workspace in a container, do it. If you're not prompted follow these steps:

- Open the VS Code command pallette by hitting `CTRL + SHIFT + P` on your keyboard.
- Start typing "Dev Containers"
- Select "Open workspace in container"

That's it! Create an issue if you have any questions. If you'd like a more detailed tutorial check out the [VS Code Dev Container Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
